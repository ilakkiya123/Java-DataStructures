Data Structures :

Datas  

Abstract data type - Data <-> Operation <-> Concept 

It mainly involves on how data is operated than the ideaology of how it is implemented .

Array , memory address and index 

Read , Search , Insert 

Product work -> Optimisation 

Space Complexity - less memory 
Time Complexity - less time 

O(1) - constant - to check odd or even , to check first element in an array how large the array is 
O(n) - linear - to find the sum of the element , to traverse to find the largest number 
O(log n ) - Binary Search 
O(n log n ) - Merge Sort 
O(n2) - Bubble Sort 


O(1)  - Constant - to find the first ele in an array 
O(n)  - Linear - for loop to traverse in all elements 
O(log n ) - Logarthmic - Binary Search
O(n^2) - Quadratic -  2 for loops 
O(2^n) - Exponential - Fibonacci recursion 
O(n log n ) - Merge Sort
